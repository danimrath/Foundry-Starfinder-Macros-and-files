# Foundry-Starfinder-Macros

THIS IS NOT A FOUNDRY MODULE. ALL MACRO CODES MUST BE COPIED AND PASTED INTO FOUNDRY MANUALLY~

All Macros listed are for use in VTT Foundry, Starfinder system.

Conditions & FX macro requires Token Magic FX mod: https://foundryvtt.com/packages/tokenmagic/
(This Macro has not been maintained)

The import settings for Automated Animations use the Patreon JB2A animations https://foundryvtt.com/packages/JB2A_DnD5e and the Games Audio Bundles https://foundryvtt.com/packages/gAudioBundle-1 2 3 and 4. Audio references currently reflect Forge's file structure. If using outside Forge, the audio file reference should still work, since it references an online asset
