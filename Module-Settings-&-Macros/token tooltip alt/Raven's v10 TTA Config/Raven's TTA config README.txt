Disclaimer: almost all of the credit for this config should go to InfamousSky#9002 on Discord and their pf2 TTA config, as well as Iankid#3802 and LebombJames#1611 for their Starfinder knowhow and TTA configs. JS is not something I fully understand, so I took a lot of features from their configs and implemented them into mine, changing things to work for Starfinder. Anyway, this is the config I (Raven#6097) use for my Starfinder games, and I wanted to include this simple readme to explain how it functions. Everything is presented in the order that it appears in the tooltip.
